## What is this?

If you've ever needed to print out lecture slides, meeting decks, or any multi-page PDF as a compact handout (2, 4, 6, or 9 slides per page), this is for you. Just drag and drop your PDF, pick a layout, and download the result. No sign-up, no uploads, no waiting.

## Why This Exists

I got tired of the same frustrating cycle every time I needed to print lecture slides:

- **Adobe Acrobat?** Buried in menus, confusing options, requires a subscription.
- **Online tools?** Upload my confidential slides to some random server? No thanks.
- **Desktop apps?** Install sketchy software just to print 4 slides per page?

I just wanted something simple: drag, drop, done. So I built it.

No accounts. No uploads. No tracking. Just a tool that respects your time and your privacy.

## Getting Started

### Use it online

The easiest way is to use the hosted version (if deployed). No installation needed. https://hand-outs.com

### Run it locally

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-handout-studio.git
cd pdf-handout-studio

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## How It Works

The app is built with **Next.js 14** using the App Router, **React 18**, and **TypeScript**.

### Architecture

```
app/           --> Next.js App Router pages (layout.tsx, page.tsx)
components/    --> React UI components (controls, preview, upload zone, etc.)
lib/           --> Core logic and utilities
styles/        --> Global CSS and Tailwind config
```

### The layout engine

When you configure a handout, the layout engine (`lib/layoutEngine.ts`) calculates the exact positions and sizes for each slide slot on the output page. It handles:

- Grid calculations based on pages-per-sheet and orientation
- Margin and spacing math (all in millimeters, converted to PDF points)
- Slot positioning for consistent layouts

### PDF generation

The actual PDF creation happens in `lib/generateHandout.ts` using **pdf-lib**. This library lets us:

- Embed pages from the source PDF into new pages
- Scale and position each slide precisely
- Add frames, page numbers, and notes lines
- Output a new PDF that preserves vector quality

Since pdf-lib runs entirely in JavaScript, there's no server needed, the browser does all the work.

### Preview rendering

For the live preview, we use **pdfjs-dist** (Mozilla's PDF.js) to render pages to a canvas. The worker is lazy-loaded to keep initial page load fast.

### Theming

Dark and light modes use **next-themes** with CSS variables. Your preference is remembered in localStorage.

## Privacy

This is a big one. **Your PDFs never leave your device.**

- No server uploads
- No analytics tracking your documents
- No cloud processing

The entire app runs client-side. When you "export" a PDF, your browser generates it locally and triggers a download.
